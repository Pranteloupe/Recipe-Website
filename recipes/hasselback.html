        <h3>Time: 1 hour 15 minutes</h3>

        <h3>Servings: 6</h3>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 Russet potatoes</li>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup melted butter</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>8 thin slices cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>4 slices bacon</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons green onions</li>
            <li>Cooking spray</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line a sheet pan with foil, then coat the foil with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Place a potato on a cutting board between two chopsticks. Slice the potato into 1/4 inch thick slices, 
                the chopsticks will prevent you from cutting all the way through.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process with the remaining potatoes. Place the potatoes on the sheet pan.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, butter, salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Brush the olive oil mixture all over the potatoes, making sure to get some in between the slices.</li>
            <li>Bake for 50-60 minutes until potatoes are tender and browned.</li>
            <li>Remove the potatoes from the oven; let them cool for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Insert the cheddar cheese slices in between each cut of the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Return the potatoes to the oven and bake for an additional 3-5 minutes or until cheese is melted.</li>
            <li>Top each potato with a dollop of sour cream, then sprinkle the bacon and green onions over the top. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
